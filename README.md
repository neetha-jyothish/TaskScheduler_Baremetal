# Project Description
This project is same as [TaskScheduler_STM32CubeIDE](https://github.com/neetha-jyothish/TaskScheduler_STM32CubeIDE), with the difference being, this was built using a custom Makefile without using STM32CubeIDE. The idea behind this is to understand how to use the ARM GNU Toolchain to compile and link multiple files for an embedded baremetal firmware. The startup code and linker script is written from scratch, and debugging is done using OpenOCD. 

This will give a solid understanding of what exactly happens under the hood when we build a project using STM32CubeIDE.

# Project Description
This project is same as https://github.com/neetha-jyothish/TaskScheduler_STM32CubeIDE, with the difference being, this was built using a custom Makefile without using STM32CubeIDE. The idea behind this is to understand how to use the ARM GNU Toolchain to compile and link multiple files for an embedded baremetal firmware.
